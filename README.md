A micro air vehicle (MAV) is a class of aircraft that has size restriction. The purpose of this project is to design a MAV, the airplane designed will be an RC (Radio Controlled) which can carry highest payload fraction possible with lowest empty weight, based on the guidelines of flight mechanics, aircraft structures, aerodynamics and control systems. This project aims to fabricate the designed MAV emphazing on all the structural aspects and other constraints respectively and to demonstrate its mission profile. The MAV has a double-bubble fuselage configuration with a rectangular high wing having a conventional tail configuration. The lateral cross-sectionof the wing is a cambered airfoil whose profile governs the lift distribution over the wing span. The wing span is around 4.8 feet and the model is fabricated using balsawood in this project.
